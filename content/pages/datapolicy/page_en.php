			<h4>1.2 Evaluation by means of Matomo. Opt-out possible.</h4>
			<p>The website OpenParliament.TV uses&nbsp;<a href="http://www.matomo.org">Matomo</a>, an open source web analysis tool, for evaluation. No cookies are set in the process. We use the information collected to evaluate usage and to compile reports on website activity.</p>
			<p>OpenParliament.TV will not transfer this information to third parties.</p>
			<p>By using this website, you consent to the processing of data about you by OpenParliament.TV in the manner and for the purposes set out above. If you would like to switch off the analysis by Matomo, you can do so using this link:&nbsp;<a href="https://stats.openparliament.tv/index.php?module=CoreAdminHome&amp;action=optOut&amp;language=de" target="_blank">To the opt-out page.</a>. This sets a so-called opt-out cookie with the name "piwik_ignore", which signals to Matomo that it should not analyse your behaviour.</p>
			<h4>1.3 Personal reference cannot be completely ruled out in individual cases.</h4>
			<p>The collection of personal information can be almost completely avoided by using Matomo and shortening the IP address. However, a traceability of this data to individual persons cannot be completely ruled out in individual cases, at least theoretically.</p>
